NetSentinel is a Python-based network recon utility designed to perform targeted port scans, banner grabs, and TLS certificate analysis with situational awareness.
It's fast, smart, and expandableâ€”built for developers, security students, and curious engineers who want a deeper look into their targets without crossing the ethical line.

- Ping & Reachability Check
Confirms whether a host is alive before scanning.
- Port Scanning (TCP SYN)
Scans a custom port range and flags all open ports.
- Banner Grabbing
Attempts to retrieve service banners from open ports to infer running software.
- TLS Certificate Scanning
For services offering TLS (like HTTPS), it fetches and parses certificates to reveal:
- Issued To / By
- Validity Dates
- Expiry warnings
- Error Handling with Clarity
Catches and reports issues with clean, focused messages.
- Modular & Extensible
Designed to be easily upgraded with threading, logging, WHOIS, GeoIP, and more.

You'll be prompted for:
- IP address or hostname
- Start and end ports to scan
- Optional TLS certificate inspection (if scanning port 443
